# Compound Wallet Risk Scoring

# Data Collection (Assumed)
For each wallet, we would fetch on-chain Compound V2 transactions (Supply, Borrow, Repay, Liquidation) via Covalent/Etherscan API.

#Features Used
- **deposit_count / total_deposit_amount** → how much collateral they supplied
- **borrow_count / total_borrow_amount** → borrowing behavior
- **repay_ratio** → repaid vs borrowed
- **liquidation_count** → risky wallets get liquidated more
- **liquidation_ratio** → normalizing liquidations by borrowing volume

#Scoring Logic
Base score = 500  
- +200 if repay_ratio > 0.8  
- +150 if no liquidations  
- +50 if deposits > borrows  
- -200 if liquidation_ratio > 0.3  
- -100 if borrows > deposits*2  
Clipped between 0–1000.

#Output
- `wallet_scores.csv` with `wallet_id,score`

This approach is scalable for any number of wallets and can integrate real Compound on-chain data.
